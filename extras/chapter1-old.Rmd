## How are you feeling right now? 
#  I am excited about the course. It is a bit intimitating, 
#  since it seeems that there is quite a lot of work. 
#  But, I cant wait to be able to apply my knowledge that
#  I will learn here to my own research.  

## What do you expect to learn? 
#  I am a PhD student and I found the course content very 
#  fitting for my needs. I am the most excited to learn more #  about GitHub and R Markdown. Also, 2 model validation, 
#  4 clustering/classification, and dimensionality reduction
#  techniques are very interesting topics. I am doing my
#  PhD on psychometric validation of Warwick-Edinburgh 
#  Mental Well-being Scale. 

## Where did you hear about the course?
#  I remember taking one of the Kimmo's course almost 10 
#  years ago, when I was an undergraduate. Even though the 
#  course at the time was held in very early mornigns, I 
#  really enjoyed his class. When I noticed (in Sisu) that 
#  he is holding an online course, I signed up immediately.
